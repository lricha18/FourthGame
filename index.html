<h2>Capture the Star</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Be the first player to accumulate 20 points either by capturing the star or shooting the other player.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Some experience with capture the flag and shooting games might be needed.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is a two person arcade game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
This game supports two players on a single keyboard. Player 1 flies their player with the arrow keys and fires bullets with the M key. Player 2 flies around using the combination of the WASD keys corresponding to up, left, down, and right respectively and fires bullets with the F key. This game detects collisions between the two players and resets them to the starting positions. The game also detects a player colliding with the star which will increase their score and create a new star at a random location on the screen. Lastly, this game detects a bullet hitting a player. When this happens, the shooter's score increases, and the player hit is reset to the starting position.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype is to create a game with the capture objective. Also, this game was made to learn how to fire projectiles at other players and detect collisions.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
2 Players, each can fly a UFO around and shoot at each other while capturing a star.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game takes place at the edge of the Andromeda galaxy.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The spacecrafts are out hunting stars to collect when they encounter each other, so they fight to collect the most stars. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game targets an audience of children and adults of all ages. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
2-5 Minutes. Can be replayed multiple times.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best strategy is not to fly straight toward the stars. A player must take into account the position of the other player, where their bullets are, and where the star is, if they plan to win this game.
